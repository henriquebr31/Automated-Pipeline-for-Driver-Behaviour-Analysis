Work developed in my Master's thesis in Data Science and Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto entitled 'Developing an Automated Pipeline for Driver Behaviour Analysis' 

To use the pipeline interface, run the following command in the terminal: python configuration.py

To create the required conda interface: conda env create -f environment.yml

The models.ipynb file contains some models created with the aim of detecting driver drowsiness.
